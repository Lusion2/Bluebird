 * Bluebird is a project I am making in an attempt to learn more about graphics programming
 * and the WIN32 API and minimal OpenGL (software rendering)
 *
 * Currently, this project will be a software renderer but in the future I may consider looking at
 * implementing more OpenGL functionality instead of my own code
 *
 * Documentation will be made procedurely as I create this project
 *
 *
 * Bluebird functions and data structures will be prefixed with "bb"
 * For example, bbWindow or bbCreateWindow()
